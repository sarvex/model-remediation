"""Utils to validate and manipulate MinDiff structures (single elems or dicts).

This module is a customized version of `tf.nest` with the main difference being
that tuples are considered single elements rather than structs that can be
unpacked.

  """Flattens a MinDiff structure after optionally validating it.

  Arguments:
    struct: structure to be flattened. Must be a single element (including a
      tuple) or an unnested dict.
    run_validation: Boolean indicating whether to run validation. If `True`
      `validate_min_diff_structure` will be called on `struct`.

  Has similar behavior to `tf.nest.flatten` with the exception that tuples will
  be considered as single elements instead of structures to be flattened. See
  `tf.nest.flatten` documentation for additional details on behavior.

  Returns:
    A Python list, the flattened version of the input.

  Raises:

      including a tuple, or a dict).
